# Task 3: Decision Tree Classifier - Predicting Customer Purchases

## Project Overview
This is the third task assigned to me as an intern at Prodigy InfoTech. In this project, I have developed a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

## Objective
The main goal of this task is to build a machine learning model that accurately classifies customers into two categories: those who are likely to make a purchase and those who are not. This classification helps in targeting the right customers for marketing campaigns, thereby improving sales efficiency.

## Data Description
The dataset used for this project includes various features related to customer demographics and behavior, such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Income
- Marital Status
- Purchase History
- Browsing Behavior

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Encoded categorical variables.
   - Normalized/standardized numerical features.

2. **Model Building**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn.
   - Tuned hyperparameters to optimize the modelâ€™s performance.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Analyzed the decision tree to understand feature importance and decision rules.

## Results
The Decision Tree Classifier achieved satisfactory performance metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting customer purchases. The model's insights can be used to better understand customer segments and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Conclusion
This task provided valuable hands-on experience with decision tree algorithms and the process of building predictive models. The skills and knowledge gained from this project will be instrumental in tackling more complex machine learning challenges in the future.
